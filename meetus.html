											Hello, my name is Ben Tomlinson, English is my first and only language except for programming, which I’m learning. I’m a gamer and have been since I was little, this started with mine sweep, solitaire, then moved onto Sponge Bob and Star Wars. The platforms I use are PC and PlayStation, the innerworkings of a game is what brought my attention to a career in IT. My interest in IT is how software communicates to hardware for processing and completing a task, from receiving input whether through a user or automation, then to output. What intrigued me about IT, was watching my dad pull apart his computer and operate without knowing how or why. He then gave his old computer to my brother, sisters and I, from then as we didn’t know much about computers and being kids the only thing, we could do was to play games. This got me started being a gamer but also my interest in software because I didn’t know what was occurring in the background while interacting with it. My experience in IT has mainly been from TAFE, I completed a certificate two and three within a year, while doing this I was dabbling in website development.

											I was born in Perth, Western Australia. My great grandparents were all born somewhere in Europe, a mix of English, Scottish, German and Polish nationalities. I have never felt the need or desire to learn another language as I have always lived somewhere in Australia, however I can order my favourite foods using smatterings of Indonesian when on holidays in Bali, where I travel with my family a couple of times a year. After high school I completed an Advanced Diploma in Performing Arts (Audio Engineering) from the WA Academy of Performing Arts and since then I have attained certification in various products, technologies and process frameworks (such as ITIL Foundations and Prince 2 project management Foundations and Practitioner) but no further higher education. I have a keen interest in film and music so my only real hobbies are watching films and Netflix or playing guitar. That said, my interest in guitar has expanded over the years to repairing and building guitars and I have recently started building guitar pedals. I have always been interested in science and technology, but my interest in IT centres around knowing how something works and how to set it up, not just using it. My first exposure to IT was in the early 1980’s. I was about 8 and my grandfather (who was an accountant) started learning about computers. He soon wrote his own tax auditing software for regional councils across WA and travelled from town to town at various times of the year preparing council audits using the system he wrote. When I was about 10, he bought us a 286 PC with monochrome screen, floppy disk drive and dot matrix printer. There was no windows GUI so we used DOS commands, but it had a word processor and a couple of games (I am struggling to remember all that as it was 30 years ago!). Even though I never studied IT, my first career as an audio engineer comprised of technical roles in the film, television and live music industries, where many of the tools to do my work were IT based. This led to working with IT hardware and software issues regularly and, having found an aptitude as an IT generalist, I ended up looking for IT roles quite quickly as there are many more opportunities in IT than the tiny Australian film industry! My first “IT” role was for an event management company, where I would create small websites, make corporate videos and manage the audio visual and IT setup for conferences. From there I went to a role as an audio visual design consultant at an engineering firm (my first corporate office job) where I learnt to design security systems and network cabling infrastructure for office buildings. That consulting role led to an opportunity working in the IT operations department at a mining company where I have worked in various roles for the last 8 years.

											I am currently taking this course as part of a Bachelor of Business (Logistics and SCM major) through RMIT. I have two units to complete after this unit so looking forward to getting it all wrapped up. I’m married with two kids aged 2 and 4 and currently employed as Superintendent of Rail Operations for a large Iron Ore Mining company in Western Australia. I was born and raised in NZ before moving to Perth about 12 years ago. The only language I speak is English, however I did once try to learn Japanese but very quickly realised I was not linguistically gifted. A couple of interesting facts: I have flown so many times for work that I now have lifetime gold membership; I have spent my entire working career in the mining industry; At 36 years of age I appear to be having a mid-life crisis and have started tackling events like half-ironmans, long distance oceans swims and also climbed Mt. Kilamanjaro with my wife. My key interest in IT presently is further exploring ways that I can leverage IT to make my current role more effective through improving the performance of the Rail network. My interest in IT has not neccessarily started in the last 3-4 years, however it has certainly increased over this period as I have seen firsthand how beneficial timley analysis of all available data can help me improve performance. Historically I have made educated guesses as to which areas to focus on to improve performance, whereas now most decisions are supported by analysis of a range of key inputs. The way our team now creates various dashboards through applications such as Spotfire puts all the data at our fingertips in an easy to interpret view. My experience with IT involves the daily use of everyday tools such as emails and more recently the use of dashboards and company ERP’s such as SAP.
