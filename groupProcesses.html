											<h3>Group Reflection on Assignment 2</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
										There are many facets to this group assignment that worked well. We had one team member take the role of team leader, breaking up the assignment into discrete tasks and setting up the collaboration tools we utilised for version control and communication. Our assignment tasks were tracked in a spreadsheet so we could visualise progress throughout the assignment period. We largely self-assigned tasks, allowing team members to select elements of interest or aptitude. The task load for each team member was fairly equal and the quality of work produced has been good. Our collaboration tools allowed for chat via desktop or mobile application, enabling the team to communicate even while one member was overseas during the assignment period.
										</p>

										<p>
											Some ideas could be implemented to improve the group performance, such as scheduling a weekly conference call. This would be an improvement on the “chat only” communication model we used in Assignment 2, but would also serve as a status update on individual progress against assignment tasks. Forming groups in a single time zone would also assist in faster communication, as the three-hour time difference between Perth and Melbourne along with work commitments meant the chat response time was sometimes up to 24 hours. Setting staggered due dates for various assignment tasks before the assignment due date is perhaps the most important idea that we could implement, especially where completing some tasks is dependent on others being completed first. In this assignment we planned for all content to be collated two days prior to the due date, but this left us with a hump of work as a couple of team members pulled out of the course right near the deadline without contributing anything to the assignment.
										</p>

										<p>
										One surprising observation from the assignment was how easily everyone agreed on decisions regarding the assignment content and structure. Usually you find competing opinions in a group and at least two individuals who really push for their point to be the winner. In this group we reached a consensus easily and there were no conflicting opinions.
										</p>

										<p>
											We have learned a few things about groups through this assignment. Groups need a leader, both to set direction and coordinate effort. In that regard it’s clear that groups benefit from different personality types, not everyone can be the leader. Groups also need to be flexible, in this case certain members had to pick up the slack when other members left the group unexpectedly.
